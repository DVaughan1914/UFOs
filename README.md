# UFOs
UFO sightings- Using Javascript, bootstrap to make a UFO sightings web page.

## Overview of the Project
  This project consists of building an HTML page that will allow us to retrieve information from a javascript data file using various filters of the page to refine search and criterias. The filters are there to provide search and filter options to the user on the various UFO sightings throughtout the United States. This search is basesd on areas of sightings and shapes.
 
## HTML PAGE AND RESULTS

  Upon entering the website the user will see the main page with background and introduction paragraph. When the user scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters that we have(which is in the image below). From this image below we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

 ## SUMMARY
   I created a page that looks simple, easy to use, also allows the user to filter through the different sitings in our data set using the search bars created. One big drawback about our search bar is trying to validate the sitings that happened which can be better described in the data. If we had how many people were at the siting would be a helpful element to validating the claims. Having as much data as possible for website would make it as good as it can possible be. My two recommendations for improving this website would 1. Have more data that has more information including how many people were at the site 2.Including another filter to find the sightings by lenth (time of sighting in seconds and mins) and last but not least have a dynamic site with real time data as the sightings are reported.
